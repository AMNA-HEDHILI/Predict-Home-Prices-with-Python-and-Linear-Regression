# Predict-Home-Prices-with-Python-and-Linear-Regression
A simple machine learning project that predicts house prices based on their size using Linear Regression.

📌 What This Project Does
This Python script analyzes the relationship between house size (in square feet) and price, then builds a model to predict prices for new houses. It's a great introduction to machine learning concepts!

📊 How It Works
Loads housing data from a CSV file (home_dataset.csv)

Visualizes the data with a scatter plot

Trains a Linear Regression model to find patterns

Makes predictions on unseen data

Shows results comparing actual vs. predicted prices
